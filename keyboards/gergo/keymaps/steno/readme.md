This layout has a layer that uses the TxBolt Stenograph protocol over a Virtual Serial port. It requires something like Plover in order to function.

In Plover, you can select TX Bolt as the Stenotype Machine, and find the COM port that was assigned. In this way, your regular keyboard will still function normally, and you can switch back and forth between the Steno and Keyboard layers.
